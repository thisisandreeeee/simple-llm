# simple-llm

Fine-tune a small language model to write using [ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English](https://www.asd-ste100.org/).

The first version will compare a base Qwen model with a supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model. Preference training comes only after the SFT pipeline and evaluation are working end to end.

The model should:

1. Prefer sentences shorter than about 20 words.
2. Prefer common words when they are accurate.
3. Prefer active voice.
4. Avoid unnecessary qualifiers and hedging.
5. Express one main idea per sentence.
6. Avoid long introductory clauses.
7. Preserve necessary technical terms.
8. Never trade factual correctness for simplicity.

## Setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then create the project environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Dependencies and source files will be added in later phases.
